A simple way to fetch Firebase content and display it in an HTML table

If you're new to Firebase, the following screenshot helps you understand the structure of the database that will easily work with the code provided. 

This firebase structure is for a simple survey that has a total of 11 fields( 9 question fields (q1 to q9), a contact details field and a comments field). Each entry has a unique Id (the ones starting with 'L8' in the screenshot given) which in this case acts as the equivalent of a Unique Id in a standard relational database.
